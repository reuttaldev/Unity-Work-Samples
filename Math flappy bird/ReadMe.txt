I have developed a flappy game with a twist- it is meant to teach basic math. This game was made over 48 hours only.
The game is built on Unity 2019.4.1

Game rules:
- Move the bird up by pressing the space key.
- There is a math equation at the top of the screen. In the obstacles (clouds) coming through, you will see possible results to the equation.
- If you hit the wrong result, the game is over and you lose.
- If you hit the correct result, you will get a point and the game will continue to the next equation.
- There are two ways the gameplayer changes over time to increase the difficulty and make it more intractable; 
each time you answer correctly, the clouds will start to pass by a little faster and there will be more obstacles.
Each milestone you pass (for example, 8 correct answers), the math equation will get harder. the specifics are mentioned in GameController.
- There are also "coins" in the game you can earn by flying through them. They count as a bonus and will be added to your end score.



Also, here is another game using Godot and C#, made in the same time frame:
