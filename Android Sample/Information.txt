This is an Android app I solo developed using Unity. 
It has the purpose of displaying educational information on slides, to teach children.
It includes using the Android camera, a calendar to add events and reminders, 
A drawing canvas with text and stickers to practice the information taught, particle effects, and more.
This was the very first working version of the app.
