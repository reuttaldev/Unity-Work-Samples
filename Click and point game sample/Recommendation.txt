Here is what the client for this game had to say at the end of our work journey: 


Hello Reut,

Hope all is well on your side.

I have decided to mark the current job as complete and end it. I'll be leaving it with positive comment and great rating.

Hopefully, may be someday we will work together again.

Your contribution to the project have boosted my morale and confidence to keep working on it. I cannot thank you enough.

Take Care and please keep up the good work. Upwork needs more people like you.

Regards.
