This is an HTML5 game I created in less than 3 days.
A 3D game set in a zoo with the role of being a zoo keeper.
I created this using Unity's Universal Render Pipeline, free assets converted to URP, and the Terrain Tools to develop an immersive environment.
I applied all aspects of game design, from start to finish - level design, scripting, lighting, sfx, and animations.
Also includes: - Git support using Using Git Large File Storage (LFS) 
- WebGL build optimization using the build editor log and texture compression.
